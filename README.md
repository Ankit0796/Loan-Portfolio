## Business Context:

A mid-sized digital lending company offers personal loans to individuals across India. The company has been issuing loans since 2013 and has amassed over 200,000 loan records. They now want to monitor loan performance, borrower profiles, and credit risk using a comprehensive Power BI dashboard.

## Business Goals and Objectives
1.	Track overall loan performance: total disbursed amount, interest income, average loan size.
2.	Reduce default rate: identify high-risk borrower patterns by credit score, income, employment type, DTI ratio.
3.	Optimize customer acquisition: identify which demographics and loan purposes are most profitable.
4.	Support data-driven lending decisions: build borrower profiles that reduce risk while maximizing growth.
5.	Monitor portfolio growth and trends over time and across segments.

## Key Business Questions to Answer

## Setup Instructions for Power BI Gateway Integration with SQL & Incremental Refresh


### 1. Prepare the SQL Database
- Ensure your SQL Server is accessible and has the required data views/tables.
- Use indexed datetime columns for incremental refresh logic.

### 2. Develop Power BI Report
- Load data from SQL Server using DirectQuery or Import mode.
- Apply filters using parameters like `RangeStart` and `RangeEnd` in Power Query.
- Define policies for incremental refresh in the Power BI model settings.

### 3. Configure On-Premises Gateway
- Install and register the [On-Premises Data Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-install) on your server.
- Map your local SQL connection to the cloud Power BI service.

### 4. Publish & Schedule Refresh
- Publish the Power BI report to Power BI Service.
- Set up the data source credentials and schedule refresh via the gateway.
## üîÑ Incremental Refresh Logic

Ensure your table contains a **DateTime column** to be used for partitioning. Power BI uses `RangeStart` and `RangeEnd` parameters for dynamic filtering.
